Zotero 3.x Opera connector
Center for History and New Media
Opera Connector Martin Haa√ü <haass@ira.uka.de>

Basic functionality is there ( I mainly save to zotero standalone & don't use the server storage). The unavailable/broken features mostly depend on functions which are not provided by Opera

=== What's working ===
* Icon in navigation bar
* saving to standalone zotero
* progress window
* loading of translators
* preferences page
 - update status
 - update translators
 - reset Translators

=== TODO ===
* local/session storage does not work -> preferences cannot be saved
* test server mode
* preferences page
  - save via server: not tested
  - open translator test: not working: Opera does not support accessing background URL's from injected scripts
  - debug: not tested
* include icons in data: URI's. Opera does not support accessing background URL's from injected scripts
* context menu not (yet) supported in mainline Opera

=== Why things are the way they are ===
* include files start with numbers?
 - Opera does not have a JS tag in their config xml
 - Opera loads the injected script in alphabetical sort order *duh*
